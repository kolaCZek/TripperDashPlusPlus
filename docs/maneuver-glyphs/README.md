# Tripper Dash — Maneuver Glyph Catalog

Empirical glyph rendering for every byte value `0x00..0x81` of the
**maneuver TLV** sent to the Royal Enfield Tripper Dash (model "K1G",
bike: Guerrilla 450 / Himalayan 450).

The dashboard receives a single-byte maneuver code in the K1G TLV:

```
05 02 00 01 <maneuver_byte>           # primary form
05 03 00 02 <maneuver_byte> <unused>  # secondary form (observed)
```

This document is the ground truth for what each byte renders as in the
**active-nav bubble** (the round overlay shown over the map view when
turn-by-turn is active).

## Capture context

- **Date**: 2026-06-21
- **Source video**: `IMG_4587_2.mov` (1080p HEVC, 30 fps, 400 s, rotated +22° CW)
- **Capture method**: [`ManeuverScannerLoop`](../../TripperDashPP/Navigation/ManeuverScannerLoop.swift)
  walks `0x00..0xFF` with `holdSeconds=5`. The phone sends
  `primaryManeuver: byte` together with `roadName: "SCAN 0xNN"` for the
  **same** byte — see [`ManeuverScannerLoop.swift#sendNavPacket`](../../TripperDashPP/Navigation/ManeuverScannerLoop.swift#L183). The dash renders both: the active-nav bubble on
  the left, and the burned "SCAN 0xNN" label at the bottom. **The
  burned label is the authoritative ground truth.**
- **Coverage**: `0x00..0x81` (130 bytes). `0x82..0xFF` not yet scanned —
  needs a second field-run.
- **Extraction**: each glyph crop is **self-labeled** — the SCAN text under the
  bubble appears in every PNG so you can verify the byte → glyph mapping
  by eye without trusting any external mapping.

## Glyph index status

The catalog re-build on 2026-06-21 replaced the earlier timing-based
mapping (which was misaligned) with **OCR-anchored** mapping that reads
the burned SCAN label directly:

| Status | Count | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| ✅ **anchor** | 85 | OCR of the SCAN label parsed cleanly — image and label match |
| 🟡 **interpolated** | 43 | OCR missed in that frame, image picked by linear interp between neighbouring anchors — verify against the SCAN label visible inside the PNG |
| 📸 **user photo** | 1 | `0x00` captured directly from dash via phone photo (user-supplied, SCAN label visible) |
| 🔄 **legacy** | 1 | `0x01` not captured in this scan — synthesized from earlier user-confirmed scan (no SCAN label burned) |
| ⚪ **not scanned** | 126 | `0x82..0xFF` — pending second field-run |

A glyph marked **interpolated** is still a real bubble frame from the
video — the OCR just couldn't read the label cleanly in that specific
frame. The SCAN label inside the PNG is the ground truth; if it doesn't
match the row's byte, the row is misaligned and needs re-extraction.

## Quick reference (user-confirmed; rest pending re-classification)

| Byte | Glyph | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `0x00` | 📍↑ | **Arrival — destination AHEAD** (pin directly above straight arrow, user-photo) |
| `0x01` | 📍AHEAD-variant | (legacy scan; earlier "LEFT" interpretation was misaligned) — **pending re-classify** |
| `0x02` | 📍AHEAD-variant | (similar to 0x01, pin position differs) — **pending re-classify** |
| `0x03` | ⤵ | **Y-fork up — stay LEFT** (thicker left leg, user-confirmed in earlier scan) — re-verify against scan2 |
| `0x04` | ⤴ | **Y-fork up — stay RIGHT** (thicker right leg, user-confirmed) — re-verify against scan2 |
| `0x05`..`0x81` | various | Captured but **not yet labelled** — see catalog below |
| `0x82`..`0xFF` | ❓ | **Not scanned** — pending second field-run |

> **Important**: the earlier text descriptions for `0x05..0x81` were
> derived from a misaligned mapping and have been removed. Re-labeling
> proceeds row-by-row from the actual glyph in each PNG.

## How to send a custom maneuver

The dash will render any glyph code you send. From phone-side code:

```swift
// Send single primary maneuver:
await link.sendActiveNav(
    primaryManeuver: 0x33,                    // any byte 0x00..0x81 from catalog
    primaryDistanceMeters: 200,
    primaryUnit: 0x30,                         // 0x30 = metres
    totalDistanceMeters: 1200,
    totalDistanceUnit: 0x30,
    useCommaDecimal: false,
    decimalFmtOn: false,
    roadName: "Main St",
    eta: Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 600),
    is24Hour: true,
    remainingSeconds: nil
)
```

Bytes in `0x82..0xFF` likely fall in the "hidden bubble" range that
suppresses the overlay — useful as a "no maneuver" signal.

## Catalog (byte → glyph)

Each entry shows the bubble captured from the dash. The `100m` distance
under the symbol comes from a separate TLV (see
[`k1g-tlv-catalog.md`](../k1g-tlv-catalog.md)) and is unrelated to the
maneuver byte. Every captured PNG includes the burned `SCAN 0xNN` label
at the bottom for self-verification.

Legend: ✅ = anchor (OCR-confirmed), 🟡 = interpolated, 🔄 = legacy.

## How to regenerate

```bash
# 1. Run scanner mode on phone via ManeuverScannerLoop with holdSeconds=5.
# 2. Mount Tripper, ride briefly, switch to "Active Nav (Scan)" mode.
# 3. Record video of the dash (selfie stick + 1080p phone camera works
#    better than the in-app UDP recorder for visual clarity).
# 4. Crop video to dash + rotate so the SCAN text is horizontal:

ffmpeg -i SCAN_VIDEO.mov \
  -vf "rotate=22*PI/180:ow=rotw(22*PI/180):oh=roth(22*PI/180):c=black,fps=0.5" \
  -q:v 3 frames/f_%03d.jpg

# 5. Extract bubble + SCAN label region for each frame (self-labeling):
#    crop = (100, 460, 470, 830)  →  370×370 px
#    bubble visible at top, "100 m" beneath, "SCAN 0xNN" along the bottom.

# 6. OCR the SCAN label to get the ground-truth byte for each frame,
#    then map first-occurrence frame → byte for the catalog file name.

# 7. For bytes without an OCR anchor, linearly interpolate between
#    neighbouring anchors and flag the entry as 🟡 interpolated.

# 8. Verify each glyph by reading the SCAN label inside the PNG itself.
```

## Open questions / pending work

- [ ] **Range `0x82..0xFF`**: never scanned — needs second field-run with
      `holdSeconds=5`, `byte_start=0x80`
- [ ] **Re-classify `0x02..0x81`**: row-by-row labelling based on the
      self-labeled glyph image; the earlier text descriptions were
      derived from misaligned timing-based mapping and have been removed
- [ ] **Re-verify `0x00..0x04`**: scan2 video did not capture `0x00`
      and `0x01` cleanly; verify against future field-run output to
      confirm the legacy user-confirmed labels still hold for this
      bike + firmware
- [ ] **Direction-bit hypothesis** (was raised under earlier mapping):
      whether bits 7..4 control rotation direction for roundabouts —
      drop and re-derive after re-classification
